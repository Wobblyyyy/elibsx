Your brand-new, shiny, fancy, exciting, incredible, astounding, astonishing, well-developed,
beautiful, sexy, and "eeeee-lib" robotics library, elibsx!

## Features
- Advanced abstraction and utilities for robotics challenges, designed to speed up
  development, tenfold, at the very least.
- Complex and extensible toolkits, allowing for total control over your robot while
  cutting down development time and effort significantly. 

## Modules
In case you couldn't tell, there's a ton of different modules in this huge repository.
My reasoning behind this is rather simple - only a stupid person would make 6 different
repositories for 6 of the same projects, and I don't consider myself to be a stupid
person. Regardless, here ya go.
- __elibs2__
  A complete set of utilities and abstractions for _wpilibj_ and other FRC software and
  hardware. 
- __elibs3__
  A more specific, advanced, and specialized toolkit for FRC robot development.
- __ftc2__
  The elibs2 of the FTC world - tons of abstractions, utilities, templates, tools,
  and much more.
- __rlibx-frc__
  The FRC-specific distro of the ultimate and evolved rlibx library. This module/artifact
  contains a copy of the rlibx JAR with FRC utilities thrown on top.
- __rlibx-ftc__
  The FTC-specific distro of the ultimate and evolved rlibx library. This module/artifact
  contains a copy of the rlibx JAR with FTC utilities thrown on top.
- __rlibx__
  A standardized robotics library designed for allowing development between both FTC and
  FRC environments. That's right - you can use the same code you used for an FTC robot for
  an FRC robot, of course with a couple of (very minor) changes to account for differences
  in hardware.
