/**
 * Single-mode robot operation - a robot that does one thing and one thing
 * only. Maybe even well - who knows?
 *
 * <p>
 * If you're working with FTC and FRC robots, there's a pretty good chance
 * you can leave this class alone. However, if you're building a robot that
 * has a single functionality you'd like to implement, you can use this class
 * right here to do exactly that. No need to worry about having multiple
 * different modes which can be switched between - you just have one thing
 * to do here. Simple. (and sweet)
 * </p>
